TLS
Downgrade attacks

Risks with using older versions/any other past TLS vulns they’re aware of
SMTP is an insecure protocol that lacks encryption. It had to be retrofitted to increase security by adding the STARTTLS command. If the client supports encryption (TLS), it will understand the STARTTLS and initiate and encrypted email exchange. However, if the client does not know TLS, the STARTTLS command will be ignored, and the email will be sent in plaintext. Since the STARTTLS command is sent in plaintext, a MITM attacker can exploit the STARTTLS feature by executing a downgrade attack on the SMTP connection. This is facilitated by tampering with the upgrade command; the attacker can replace STARTTLS with a nonsense string, containing the same number of characters to preserve the packet size. The client will then fail to identify. In doing this, the client’s machine will revert to sending an email in plaintext. Oftentimes, a downgrade attack is launched along with a MITM attack
Although enforcing TLS for communications involving client-to-server, server-to-server communications require fail open which allow legacy servers to send emails. This is the main concern because it is unknown if the server receiving the communication is TLS enabled. The way to mitigate this is for MTA-STS to allow servers to respond with information regarding whether TLS is supported. If TLS is not supported, a fail close (email is not sent) if an upgrade negotiation is lacking. Therefore, making a TLS downgrade impossible.
