Now that the IP address of the web server is located, a connection is initiated using the internet protocol to communicate. TCP/IP is the protocol most utilized. The connection takes place using a process known as the TCP 3-way handshake. 
1.	Our (client) computer sends a SYN message to the web server asking if it is open for a new connection.
2.	If it is available for connection, the web server acknowledges with a SYN/ACK message. 
3.	Once our (client) computer receives its message, it lets the web server know that the message is received by sending an ACK message.


 Another protocol that is frequently utilized is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This protocol is connectionless and does not require the 3-way handshake. Because it does not require the connection, it is less reliable. The pros to UDP though are it is much faster. UDP is beneficial in Voice over IP (VoIP), streaming movies, or gaming. Not every packet is required for these activities. 

TCP
Requires an established connection to transmit data (connection should be closed once transmission is complete)
Able to sequence
Can guarantee delivery of data to the destination router
Retransmission of lost packets is possible
Extensive error checking and acknowledgment of data
Data is read as a byte stream; messages are transmitted to segment boundaries
Slower than UDP
Does not support Broadcasting
Used by HTTPS, HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP, etc

Sequence Numbers
Sequence numbers are an alternative way of indicating freshness. If Alice is sending a stream of messages to Bob, she can bind each one to a sequential serial number, and encryption will prevent an eavesdropper from altering any sequence number. If Bob is suspicious, he can check that the numbers in Alice's messages are incremented sequentially. It would be a straightforward matter for him to spot a replayed message since the sequence order would be incorrect and its number would duplicate that of an earlier message.
