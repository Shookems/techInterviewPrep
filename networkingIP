Differences between IPv4 and IPv6:
	IPv4 is 32 bit and IPv6 is 128 bits. That means that IPv6 has far more IP addresses (2^128) and won’t run out of them any time soon.
	
	IPv6 doesn’t have a broadcast address. IPv4 does. By default, it’s the last address on each subnet.

	The IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) provides data integrity and data authentication for the entire IPv6 packet. The IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload header provides confidentiality and/or authentication and data integrity to the encapsulated payload. Anti-replay protection is provided by both the AH and ESP Header.

Problems with IPv6:
	Older devices don’t support IPv6. So, if there are newer clients that use IPv6 only and talk to say a gateway that supports only IPv4, it’s going to break things.

	Remembering IPv6 addresses is harder, and DNS becomes a must 
	
	Needing to open firewall rules to allow ICMP traffic into the network
