Parameter								Stack
Type of data structures		A stack is a linear data structure.
Access speed				High-speed access
Space management			Space managed efficiently by OS so memory will never become fragmented.
Access						Local variables only
Limit of space size			Limit on stack size dependent on OS.
Resize						Variables cannot be resized
Memory Allocation			Memory is allocated in a contiguous block.
Allocation and Deallocation	Automatically done by compiler instructions.
Deallocation				Does not require to de-allocate variables.
Cost						Less
Implementation				A stack can be implemented in 3 ways simple array based, using dynamic memory, and 							   Linked list based.
Main Issue					Shortage of memory
Locality of reference		Automatic compile time instructions.
Flexibility					Fixed size
Access time					Faster


Parameter								Heap
Type of data structures     Heap is a hierarchical data structure.
Access speed                Slower compared to stack
Space management            Heap Space not used as efficiently. Memory can become fragmented as blocks 									of memory first allocated and then freed.
Access                      It allows you to access variables globally.
Limit of space size         Does not have a specific limit on memory size.
Resize                      Variables can be resized.
Memory Allocation           Memory is allocated in any random order.
Allocation and Deallocation It is manually done by the programmer.
Deallocation                Explicit de-allocation is needed.
Cost                        More
Implementation              Heap can be implemented using array and trees.
Main Issue                  Memory fragmentation
Locality of reference       Adequate
Flexibility                 Resizing is possible
Access time                 Slower
